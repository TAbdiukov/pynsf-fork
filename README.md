pynsf
=====

A Python-based NSF player

### Changes compared to [upsteam pynsf](https://github.com/bschlenk/pynsf)

* ImportError try-except blocks to allow portable use, which partially addresses issue [#1](https://github.com/bschlenk/pynsf/issues/1).
* Fix Python3 conversion, so the 6502 opcodes can actually be run.
